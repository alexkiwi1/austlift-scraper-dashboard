# API Updates for Real-Time Scraping Progress

## What I Need You to Implement

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- Add `current_page` column to track which page is being scraped
- Add `total_pages` column to store the total number of pages to scrape
- Add `products_processed` column to count products processed so far
- Add `products_found` column to count new products found
- Add `last_updated` timestamp column to track when progress was last updated

### 2. Backend Scraper Updates
- Modify the scraping loop to update progress every 10 products processed
- Update the current page number as it moves through pages
- Track the total number of products processed in real-time
- Track the number of new products found during scraping
- Update the `last_updated` timestamp regularly

### 3. Database Operations Updates
- Update the `update_scraping_job` function to handle the new progress fields
- Ensure it can update `current_page`, `total_pages`, `products_processed`, `products_found`, and `last_updated`
- Make sure it handles both string and integer job IDs properly

### 4. API Endpoint Updates
- Modify `/scraping-jobs` endpoint to return the new progress fields
- Add progress percentage calculation (current_page / total_pages * 100)
- Add estimated time to completion calculation
- Create new `/scraping-jobs/{job_id}/progress` endpoint for real-time progress

### 5. Expected Response Format
The API should return job data like this:
```json
{
  "id": 110,
  "status": "running",
  "current_page": 2,
  "total_pages": 5,
  "products_processed": 89,
  "products_found": 23,
  "progress_percent": 40.0,
  "last_updated": "2025-10-26T01:05:30.123456",
  "message": "Scraping page 2/5..."
}
```

### 6. What This Will Enable
- Real-time progress updates showing current page and percentage complete
- Live count of products being processed
- Live count of new products found
- Accurate completion detection
- Better user experience with meaningful progress information

### 7. Frontend Will Display
Instead of:
```
Step 3: Scraping in progress... Checked: 0, New: 0, Updated: 0 (3/60)
```

Users will see:
```
Step 3: Page 2/5 (40.0%) - Processed: 89, Found: 23 (3/60)
```

## Priority Order
1. Database schema changes first
2. Database operations updates
3. Scraper code modifications
4. API endpoint updates
5. Test with frontend

This will give you real-time, accurate progress tracking during scraping operations instead of the current static zeros.
