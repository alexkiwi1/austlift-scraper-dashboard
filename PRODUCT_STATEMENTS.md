# Product Statements - Austlift Scraper Dashboard

## Current Status: Production Ready ‚úÖ

All functionality is working as expected. Any empty fields ("-") are due to missing data in the database, not broken functionality.

---

## Problem Statement #1: Empty Fields in Product Table

**Issue:** Some product fields show "-" in the table, making it appear that data is missing.

**Root Cause:** Many products in the database legitimately have `null` values for certain fields (e.g., `sku`, `description`). This is common in scraped e-commerce data where not all product information is available.

**Current Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Table correctly displays data when available
- ‚úÖ Table correctly shows "-" when data is `null` or empty
- ‚úÖ Table correctly handles all field types (strings, numbers, dates, booleans)

**Evidence from API Testing:**
```json
{
  "id": 42393,
  "name": "Industrial Lever Block 3M Model AL-3 - 0.5T",
  "code": "121305",
  "url": "https://www.austlift.com.au/...",  // ‚úÖ Has data
  "sku": null,  // ‚ùå No data (null in database)
  "price": 281.306,  // ‚úÖ Has data
  "low_stock": false,  // ‚úÖ Has data
  "is_variation": true,  // ‚úÖ Has data
  "variation_name": "0.5T",  // ‚úÖ Has data
  "image_url": "https://cdn.n2erp.co.nz/...",  // ‚úÖ Has data
  "created_at": "2025-10-26T06:44:54.133670",  // ‚úÖ Has data
  "updated_at": "2025-10-26T06:44:54.133681",  // ‚úÖ Has data
  "scraped_at": "2025-10-26T06:44:54.133685"  // ‚úÖ Has data
}
```

**Impact:** Low. This is expected behavior for scraped data where some fields may be unavailable.

**Recommendation:** 
- Option A: Keep current behavior (shows "-" for missing data)
- Option B: Hide columns where 80%+ of products have empty values
- Option C: Add a "Data Completeness" indicator showing which products have full data

**Status:** ‚úÖ Working as designed. No action required unless user requests hiding empty columns.

## Problem Statement #2: Data Reuse Optimization

**Issue:** Clicking Step 4 would re-fetch all products from the API, even when products were already loaded in Step 3.

**Root Cause:** Step 3 was only counting products but not storing them for reuse by Step 4.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Step 3 now loads and stores products in `step4Products` state
- Step 4 checks if products already exist before making API calls
- If products exist, Step 4 reuses them instantly with message "‚úÖ Reusing existing data!"

**Impact:** High improvement to performance and user experience.

**Before:**
- Clicking Step 4 ‚Üí Makes API calls ‚Üí Shows table (slow)

**After:**
- First click Step 4 ‚Üí Makes API calls ‚Üí Shows table
- Subsequent clicks ‚Üí Instantly shows table (no API calls)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed and deployed.

## Problem Statement #3: API Field Availability

**Issue:** Some product fields are not returned by certain API endpoints, leading to empty columns in the frontend.

**Root Cause:** Different API endpoints return different field sets:
- `/products` endpoint: Basic fields (14 fields including `source`, `on_po`)
- `/products/by-category/{id}` endpoint: Extended fields (18 fields including `image_url`, `variation_name`, timestamps)

**Fields NOT available in `/products/by-category` (currently used by frontend):**
- `catalog_id`
- `source`
- `warehouse_stock`
- `parent_product_url`
- `specification_pdfs`

**Solution Implemented:**
- Frontend hides columns for fields that are not returned by the API
- Added `API_FIELD_ANALYSIS.md` document explaining discrepancies
- Updated TypeScript interfaces to match actual API responses

**Impact:** Medium. Frontend now accurately reflects available data.

**Recommendation for Backend:**
- Option A: Update `/products/by-category` to include missing fields
- Option B: Create `/products/{id}/details` endpoint with ALL fields
- Option C: Keep current implementation (frontend handles gracefully)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Frontend fixed. Backend update is optional enhancement.

## Known Limitations

1. **SKU Field:** Many products have `null` SKU values (not scraped from source)
2. **Empty Fields:** Some products have missing data (expected in scraped data)
3. **File Storage:** Product images stored in container, not directly accessible from frontend
4. **Pagination:** Currently loads all products at once (1000 limit per category)

---

## Recommendations for Future Enhancement

### Priority High
1. **Backend:** Add missing fields to `/products/by-category` endpoint
2. **Frontend:** Add data completeness indicator
3. **Backend:** Add file serving endpoint for images/PDFs

### Priority Medium
4. **Frontend:** Add virtual scrolling for large product lists
5. **Frontend:** Add export to CSV/Excel functionality
6. **Backend:** Add product detail endpoint with ALL fields

### Priority Low

8. **Frontend:** Add batch operations (select multiple products)
9. **Backend:** Add product update/edit capabilities
